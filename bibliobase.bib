	Abstract = {A cry2Aa gene with a sequence-modified open reading
                  frame encoding an insecticidal crystal protein from
                  Bacillus thuringiensis was introduced into chickpea
                  (Cicer arietinum L.) to confer resistance to
                  Helicoverpa armigera (pod borer). We used a twin
                  T-DNA binary vector containing the nptII gene for
                  selection and a chimeric cry2Aa gene driven by
                  Arabidopsis small subunit gene (ats1A) promoter. Of
                  the fifteen nptII positive lines established,
                  thirteen accumulated Cry2Aa toxin in the leaves of
                  \{T0\} plants and five transmitted the cry2Aa gene
                  to the next generation consistent with a 3:1
                  segregation. Western analysis of different organs
                  showed high levels of Cry2Aa protein in all the
                  green parts as well as in petals and
                  cotyledons. Phenotypic data showed reduced
                  productivity in two high expressing lines when
                  compared to the parental line and lines with
                  moderate expression levels. Insect bioassays using
                  the progeny of selected lines showed differential
                  resistance to pod borer larvae, depending upon the
                  level of expression of the Cry2Aa protein. A high
                  expressing line was found to confer near complete
                  protection against the pod borer. We concluded that
                  a sequence-modified cry2Aa gene expressed in
                  chickpea is effective against pod borer larvae
                  however accompanying reduction in productivity needs
                  further investigation.},

	Abstract = {Even mild to moderate vitamin A deficiency is now
                  recognized as an important factor in child health
                  and survival. This has given increased emphasis to
                  the goal of virtually eliminating vitamin A
                  deficiency and its consequences, including
                  blindness, by the end of the decade. The
                  implications of vitamin A deficiency, however, vary
                  according to the group at risk, and this needs to be
                  addressed when looking at ways to achieve the
                  goal. In pre-school children, vitamin A deficiency
                  can lead to increased risk of mortality and
                  morbidity and to blindness. In pregnant and
                  lactating women, it can lead to night-blindness and
                  appears to have implications for maternal morbidity
                  and mortality. Although the immediate health
                  consequences for schoolchildren and adolescents are
                  not completely known, they are probably less
                  dramatic. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is a
                  cross-generational cycle leading to and perpetuating
                  vitamin A deficiency in affected communities. This
                  also has implications when addressing prevention and
                  control strategies. The existing, somewhat
                  successful approach has been to target children aged
                  six months to six years; it is implicit that this
                  criterion is used to measure progress towards the
                  end-of-decade goals. A broader, complementary,
                  life-cycle approach to vitamin A deficiency is now
                  appropriate in many countries. There is increasing
                  emphasis on such approaches, i.e., fortifying foods
                  with vitamin A and improving the diet, which address
                  the whole population at risk. A mix of interventions
                  will give governments the chance to shift from a
                  subsidized vitamin A capsule programme to more
                  sustainable, non-subsidized, consumer-funded vitamin
                  A interventions, although in an appreciable number
                  of countries, supplementation with vitamin A will be
                  a necessity for some years to come. Guidelines to
                  assist governments in such transitions are a high
                  priority.},

	abstract = {There has been a recent upsurge of interest in the
                  relationship between income inequality and health
                  within nations and between nations. On the latter
                  topic Wilkinson and others believe that, in the
                  advanced capitalist countries, higher income
                  inequality leads to lowered social cohesion which in
                  turn produces poorer health status. I argue that,
                  despite a by-now voluminous literature, not enough
                  attention has been paid to the social context of
                  income inequality — health relationships or to the
                  causes of income inequality itself. In this paper I
                  contend that there is a particular affinity between
                  neo-liberal (market-oriented) political doctrines,
                  income inequality and lowered social
                  cohesion. Neo-liberalism, it is argued, produces
                  both higher income inequality and lowered social
                  cohesion. Part of the negative effect of
                  neo-liberalism on health status is due to its
                  undermining of the welfare state. The welfare state
                  may have direct effects on health as well as being
                  one of the underlying structural causes of social
                  cohesion. The rise of neo-liberalism and the decline
                  of the welfare state are themselves tied to
                  globalization and the changing class structures of
                  the advanced capitalist societies. More attention
                  should be paid to understanding the causes of income
                  inequalities and not just to its effects because
                  income inequalities are neither necessary nor
                  inevitable. Moreover, understanding the contextual
                  causes of inequality may also influence our notion
                  of the causal pathways involved in inequality-health
                  status relationships (and vice versa).}

                  individuals throughout the world, are at risk for
                  iron, vitamin A, or iodine deficiency. The three
                  main approaches to addressing micronutrient
                  deficiencies are fortification, supplementation, and
                  dietary diversification. Although fortification of
                  staple foods has played a significant role in the
                  nutritional well-being and health of the more
                  industrialized nations, it has not been considered
                  an option for less developed countries because of
                  the lack of centrally processed foods and poorly
                  developed food-marketing systems.  As food markets
                  expand, however, fortification options are becoming
                  increasingly available. This paper identifies past
                  and present successes and failures, as well as the
                  facilitating factors and constraints that need to be
                  addressed. Based on recent experience and the
                  lessons learned, successful programmes require at
                  least the following: political will and support and
                  the willingness to legislate or regulate;
                  private-sector involvement; public-sector support;
                  willingness of both sectors to enforce quality
                  assurance programmes; good data on consumption
                  patterns; social acceptability of fortified food,
                  implying no change in organoleptic properties; and

                  samples of ever-married women aged 15--49 years,
                  with or without children, were interviewed in all
                  countries, and children aged 3--36 months with
                  available weight and height data were included in
                  the analyses. Multiple linear regression controlled
                  for household, maternal, and child-level variables;
                  in addition, dummy variables were included for each
                  country. Improvements in sanitation resulted in less
                  diarrhea and in taller and heavier children with
                  each of the three levels of water
                  supply. Incremental benefits in sanitation were
                  associated with less diarrhea and with additional
                  increases in the weights and heights of
                  children. The effects of improved sanitation were
                  greater among urban dwellers than among rural
                  dwellers. Health benefits from improved water were
                  less pronounced than those for sanitation. Benefits
                  from improved water occurred only when sanitation
                  was improved and only when optimal water was
                  present. These findings suggest that public health
                  interventions should balance epidemiologic data with
                  the cost of services and the demand for water. There
                  should be efforts to develop compatible technologies
                  so that incremental improvements in service can be
                  made.},

                  confidence intervals, and statistical power have
                  been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key
                  problem is that there are no interpretations of
                  these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive,
                  correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and
                  interpretation of these statistics requires an
                  attention to detail which seems to tax the patience
                  of working scientists. This high cognitive demand
                  has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and
                  interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes
                  disastrously so---and yet these misinterpretations
                  dominate much of the scientific literature. In light
                  of this problem, we provide definitions and a
                  discussion of basic statistics that are more general
                  and critical than typically found in traditional
                  introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a
                  resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers
                  of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory
                  and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid
                  and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how
                  violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such
                  as selecting analyses for presentation based on the
                  P values they produce) can lead to small P values
                  even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and
                  can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis
                  is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of
                  25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence
                  intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines
                  for improving statistical interpretation and
                  reporting.",

@article{Lawo15072008,
	Abstract = {The use of genetically modified (Bt) crops
                  expressing lepidopteran-specific Cry proteins
                  derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus
                  thuringiensis is an effective method to control the
                  polyphagous pest Helicoverpa armigera. As
                  H. armigera potentially develops resistance to Cry
                  proteins, Bt crops should be regarded as one tool in
                  integrated pest management. Therefore, they should
                  be compatible with biological control. Bioassays
                  were conducted to understand the interactions
                  between a Cry2Aa-expressing chickpea line, either a
                  susceptible or a Cry2A-resistant H. armigera strain,
                  and the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium
                  anisopliae. In a first concentration-response assay,
                  Cry2A-resistant larvae were more tolerant of
                  M. anisopliae than susceptible larvae, while in a
                  second bioassay, the fungus caused similar
                  mortalities in the two strains fed control chickpea
                  leaves. Thus, resistance to Cry2A did not cause any
                  fitness costs that became visible as increased
                  susceptibility to the fungus. On Bt chickpea leaves,
                  susceptible H. armigera larvae were more sensitive
                  to M. anisopliae than on control leaves. It appeared
                  that sublethal damage induced by the
                  B. thuringiensis toxin enhanced the effectiveness of
                  M. anisopliae. For Cry2A-resistant larvae, the
                  mortalities caused by the fungus were similar when
                  they were fed either food source. To examine which
                  strain would be more likely to be exposed to the
                  fungus, their movements on control and Bt chickpea
                  plants were compared. Movement did not appear to
                  differ among larvae on Bt or conventional chickpeas,
                  as indicated by the number of leaflets damaged per
                  leaf. The findings suggest that Bt chickpeas and
                  M. anisopliae are compatible to control
                  H. armigera.},

	Abstract = {World pulse production and utilization declined
                  during the 1970s, reflecting a reduction in the area
                  sown to pulses in the developed countries and
                  smaller yields in developing countries, most of
                  which gave priority to cereals. With supply lagging
                  behind demand, prices increased and consumption
                  dropped sharply during the decade, particularly in
                  the developing countries where pulses are a major
                  source of protein. By the end of the 1970s, however,
                  higher prices had begun to stimulate pulse
                  production in many countries, a trend which
                  continued in the early 1980s. Looking to the future,
                  global output may continue to grow only slowly until
                  the end of the current decade, and perhaps even
                  beyond, reflecting mainly the limited attention by
                  governments to this sector.},

                  instead, it propagates a corporate, neo-liberal,

                  political parties, and the policies they implement
                  when in government, in determining the level of
                  equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of
                  the welfare state (including the level of health
                  care coverage by the state), the
                  employment/unemployment rate, and the level of
                  population health. The study looks at the impact of
                  the major political traditions in the advanced
                  \{OECD\} countries during the golden years of
                  capitalism (1945–1980) — social democratic,
                  Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist — in
                  four areas: (1) the main determinants of income
                  inequalities, such as the overall distribution of
                  income derived from capital versus labor, wage
                  dispersion in the labor force, the redistributive
                  effect of the welfare state, and the levels and
                  types of employment/unemployment; (2) levels of
                  public expenditures and health care benefits
                  coverage; (3) public support of services to
                  families, such as child care and domiciliary care;
                  and (4) the level of population health as measured
                  by infant mortality rates. The results indicate that
                  political traditions more committed to
                  redistributive policies (both economic and social)
                  and full-employment policies, such as the social
                  democratic parties, were generally more successful
                  in improving the health of populations, such as
                  reducing infant mortality. The erroneous assumption
                  of a conflict between social equity and economic
                  efficiency, as in the liberal tradition, is also
                  discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the
                  growing health and social inequalities literature,
                  which rarely touches on the importance of political
                  forces in influencing inequalities. The data used in
                  the study are largely from \{OECD\} health data for
                  1997 and 1998; the \{OECD\} statistical services;
                  the comparative welfare state data set assembled by
                  Huber, Ragin and Stephens; and the \{US\} Bureau of
                  Labor Statistics.}

	Abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health
                  Organization (FAO/WHO) International Conference on
                  Nutrition (ICN), held in Rome in December 1992,
                  recognized the widespread occurrence of
                  micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in
                  developing countries. The conference recognized
                  food-based approaches as the most effective way to
                  address existing micronutrient deficiencies. These
                  approaches must include appropriate strategies to
                  assure dietary diversification, improved food
                  availability, food preservation, nutrition
                  education, and food fortification.<br></br> The
                  final report of the conference included strategies
                  and actions for preventing and controlling specific
                  micronutrient deficiencies. It was proposed to
                  ensure and legislate the fortification of foods or
                  water with necessary micronutrients, where possible,
                  when existing supplies fail to provide adequate
                  levels in the diet. Food fortification has been
                  successfully used in both developed and developing
                  countries as one strategy to address micronutrient
                  deficiencies.<br></br> The primary purposes of food
                  legislation are to protect the health of the
                  consumer, protect the consumer from fraud, and
                  facilitate trade. In the case of fortified foods,
                  the target population must be protected from
                  receiving either toxic or nutritionally ineffective
                  levels of micronutrients. Legislation may be
                  necessary to require adequate control over this
                  fortification process by the food processors to
                  ensure that levels of micronutrients are
                  consistently within acceptable limits. Legislation
                  may also be required to prohibit the addition of
                  nutrients to commodities where it is nutritionally
                  unnecessary or unsafe or where fortification may
                  create an erroneous impression as to the nutritional
                  value of the food.<br></br> Any legislation
                  regarding food fortification should incorporate the
                  standards, recommendations, and guidelines of the
                  Codex Alimentarius. The World Trade Organization
                  (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
                  Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) and the
                  WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (the
                  TBT Agreement) have placed new importance on Codex
                  standards, guidelines, codes, and recommendations.},

	Abstract = {The technology for fortifying sugar with vitamin A
                  was developed in Guatemala in the mid-1970s, and the
                  Guatemalan government enacted legislation to make
                  fortification mandatory in June 1974. This action
                  was copied by other Central American
                  governments. The fortification programme in
                  Guatemala developed in two stages. In the first
                  (1975-77), the fortification programme was evaluated
                  four times at six-month intervals and was shown to
                  be effective. The sugar industry was responsible for
                  carrying out the programme, but the programme was
                  suspended, mainly because of economic
                  arguments. After 10 years of effort, the programme
                  was restarted in 1989. At this time the programme
                  was combined with an initial mass distribution of
                  vitamin A capsules to pre-school children, which
                  began the first successful social mobilization
                  effort in the area. The programme was evaluated for
                  six months and was shown to be effective in
                  improving the vitamin A status of the Guatemalan
                  population. This sec- ond stage has been active
                  continuously since 1989. With improvements in the
                  technology of fortification, new approaches have
                  been tested, and now it is possible to obtain an
                  excellent sugar doubly fortified with vitamin A and
                  iron, using new iron products of high
                  bioavailability that do not alter the organoleptic
                  characteristics of the sugar and do not produce
                  unwanted colour changes during processing. To avoid
                  the rancidity of premixes, new processes of dry
                  mixing have been developed in which no oil is used,
                  This opens a real possibility for the fortification
                  of sugar with other nutrients. Sugar fortified with
                  vitamin A, iron, and zinc, either alone or in any
                  combination, is commercially available in Brazil,
                  where, under the guidance of the Latin American
                  Centre of Nutrition and Metabolic Studies (CELANEM),
                  the procedures have been developed using iron amino
                  acid chelated minerals.},

	abstract = {Abstract Standard policy prescriptions for improving
                  public health in less developed countries (LDCs)
                  prioritise raising average income levels over
                  redistributive policies since it is widely accepted
                  that ‘wealthier is healthier’. It is argued that
                  income inequality becomes a significant predictor of
                  public health only after the ‘epidemiological
                  transition’. This paper tests this theory in India,
                  where rising income levels have not been matched by
                  improvements in public health. We use state-,
                  district-, and individual-level data to investigate
                  the relationship between infant and under-five
                  mortality, and average income, poverty, income
                  inequality, and literacy. Our analysis shows that at
                  both state- and district-level public health is
                  negatively associated with average income and
                  positively associated with poverty. But, at both
                  levels, controlling for poverty and literacy renders
                  average income statistically insignificant. At
                  state-level, only literacy remains a significant and
                  negative predictor. At the less aggregated
                  district-level, both poverty and literacy predict
                  public health but literacy has a stronger effect
                  than poverty. Inequality does not predict public
                  health at state- or district-levels. At the
                  individual-level, however, it is a strong predictor
                  of self-reported ailment, even after we control for
                  district average income, individual income, and
                  individual education. Our analysis suggests that
                  wealthier is indeed healthier in India – but only to
                  the extent that high average incomes reflect low
                  poverty and high literacy. Furthermore, inequality
                  has a strong effect on self-reported
                  health. Standard policy prescriptions, then, need
                  revision: first, alleviating poverty may be more
                  effective than raising average income levels;
                  second, non-income goods like literacy may make an
                  important contribution to public health; and third,
                  policy should be based on a broader understanding of
                  societal well-being and the factors that promote
                  it.}

                  deficiencies (Fe, Zn, Cu, and I) in human
                  populations around the world. The review of
                  literature indicates that fertilization with
                  inorganic and organic forms of micronutrients has a
                  potential to increase their concentrations in
                  grain. The most effective fertilization could be via
                  soil (for Zn and, to some extent, Cu), foliarly (for
                  Fe) and by adding fertilizers to the irrigation
                  water (for iodine). Care should be exercised not to
                  overfertilize crops with micronutrients because of
                  consequent toxicity and losses in quality and
                  quantity of grain yield. Effectiveness of various
                  agricultural measures in increasing micronutrient
                  density depends on soil type, crop, cultivar,
                  rotation, and environmental and other factors, thus
                  necessitating development of a specific set of
                  measures for individual regions. Agricultural
                  measures would need to be supplemented with
                  appropriate changes in the milling technology to
                  ascertain that increased micronutrient
                  concentrations in some grain parts are passed into
                  the food chain. }

	Abstract = {Chickpea, Cicer arietinum, is the third most
                  important grain legume crop in the world, with India
                  being the largest producer. Insect pests are a major
                  constraint to chickpea production. In India, the
                  legume pod borer Helicoverpa armigera is the major
                  insect pest of chickpeas. However, sap-sucking
                  insects that act as vectors for viral diseases and
                  bruchid beetles in storage are also considered
                  important pests. Here we give an overview over the
                  different management options to control these
                  pests. There is a growing interest in the genetic
                  modification of crops to enhance their resistance
                  against insect pests. Here we present the
                  state-of-the-art of chickpea transformation and give
                  an overview on the available insecticidal genes that
                  could be deployed to increase insect resistance in
                  chickpea. Prior to commercialization, transgenic
                  crops have to be assessed for their effects on the
                  environment including the possible impact on
                  non-target arthropods, many of which are important
                  for biological pest control. Therefore, the
                  arthropod--food web in the Indian chickpea system is
                  described. Possible routes through which
                  entomophagous insects could be exposed to
                  insecticidal proteins expressed by genetically
                  modified chickpeas are discussed, and species that
                  could be selected for pre-release risk assessment
                  are recommended.},

	Abstract = {Micronutrient malnutrition (`Hidden Hunger') now
                  afflicts over two billion people worldwide,
                  resulting in poor health, low worker productivity,
                  high rates of mortality and morbidity, increased
                  rates of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease,
                  cancer, stroke, and diabetes), and permanent
                  impairment of cognitive abilities of infants born to
                  micronutrient-deficient mothers. The consequences of
                  food system failures include lethargic national
                  development efforts, continued high population
                  growth rates, and a vicious cycle of poverty for
                  massive numbers of underprivileged people in all
                  nations. Our food systems are failing us globally by
                  not providing enough balanced nutrient output to
                  meet all the nutritional needs of every person,
                  especially resource-poor women, infants and children
                  in developing countries. Agriculture is partly
                  responsible because it has never held nutrient
                  output as an explicit goal of its production
                  systems. Indeed, many agricultural policies have
                  fostered a decline in nutrition and diet diversity
                  for the poor in many countries. Nutrition and health
                  communities are also partly responsible because they
                  have never considered using agriculture as a primary
                  tool in their programs directed at alleviating poor
                  nutrition and ill health globally. Now is the time
                  for a new paradigm for agriculture and nutrition. We
                  must consider ways in which agriculture can
                  contribute to finding sustainable solutions to food
                  system failures through holistic food-based system
                  approaches, thereby closely linking agricultural
                  production to improving human health, livelihood and
                  well being. Such action will stimulate support for
                  agricultural research in many developed countries
                  because it addresses consumer issues as well as
                  agricultural production issues and is, therefore,
                  politically supportable. },

                  more important determinant of health. This article

	Abstract = {The nutritional status of the population is one of
                  the important factors determining the quality and
                  productivity of the population, which in turn
                  affects national productivity. In the long term,
                  good nutritional status contributes to the
                  intelligence and health of the
                  population. Consequently, programmes directed at
                  improving the nutritional status of the population
                  will undoubtedly be a high priority in the national
                  development scheme of any country, developed or
                  developing. Food fortification, i.e., the addition
                  of nutrients to specific foods based on the dietary
                  habits and nutritional status of the target
                  population, is one of the most popular nutritional
                  interventions for improving the population's
                  nutritional status. For food-fortification
                  programmes to be successful, their technical aspects
                  need to be carefully assessed. These include the
                  nutritional justification for food fortification,
                  the acceptability of the fortified food product to
                  consumers (both cost and taste), and any technical
                  or analytical limitation to compliance with food
                  regulations and labeling requirements. Important
                  technical aspects of developing effective
                  food-fortification programmes are the choice of food
                  carrier, nutrient interactions, bioavailability of
                  nutrients, stability of nutrients added under
                  anticipated conditions of storage and processing
                  (food preparation at the household level), and
                  safety. A good fortified product should not cause
                  nutrition imbalance, and excessive intake of
                  nutrients should not have adverse effects. To
                  provide better information for the consumer, the
                  concept of overage should be introduced. Overage is
                  the use of kinetic data on nutrient stability to
                  calculate the amount of added nutrient so that the
                  anticipated level of the nutrient at the end of the
                  product's shelf life is in accordance with the level
                  indicated on the label.},

@article{acharjee2013,
	Abstract = {Chickpea productivity is affected by various
                  constraints that are biotic (Helicoverpa, Aphids,
                  Callosobruchus, Bromus and Orobanche) and abiotic
                  (drought and salinity). In addition, the grains of
                  this legume are deficient in sulfur amino acids,
                  methionine and cysteine. The possibilities for
                  genetic improvement by marker-assisted breeding and
                  selection approaches are limited in chickpeas due to
                  their sexually incompatible gene pool. Transgenic
                  chickpeas expressing either the cry1Ac/b or the
                  cry2Aa gene and the bean alpha-amylase inhibitor
                  gene are resistant to Helicoverpa and bruchids,
                  respectively, but these chickpeas have yet to be
                  commercialized. Unfortunately, attempts to generate
                  transgenic chickpeas with increased tolerance to
                  drought and salinity or with increased methionine
                  content have been less successful. The
                  commercialization of transgenic chickpeas containing
                  a single transgene may not give adequate yield
                  advantage, as chickpeas are affected by many
                  production constraints in the field and in
                  storage. Gene pyramiding by incorporating two or
                  more genes may be useful because improving one trait
                  at a time will be time-consuming, labor-intensive
                  and costly. Use of modern multi-gene vectors that
                  contain recognition sites for zinc finger nucleases
                  (ZFNs) and homing endonucleases may simplify the
                  incorporation of multiple genes into chickpeas. This
                  approach necessitates a collaborative effort between
                  individuals, public and private organizations to
                  generate 'super chickpeas' that harbor multiple
                  transgenic traits.},

                  points out that {I}ndia&#39;s groundwater sector has
                  slowed down since 2000-01, most markedly in eastern
                  {I}ndia. It examines the reasons for this and also
                  looks into how farmers have been responding to
                  lowered groundwater tables. Besides identifying some
                  factors that have not changed since the mid-1980s,
                  it emphasises that there are wide regional
                  variations in the country&#39;s groundwater economy
                  and management strategies need to be crafted
                  accordingly. },

                  Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 has

                  done to tribal and adivasi communities and other
                  forest dwellers. It confers legal entitlements on
                  the lands they were cultivating for centuries. This
                  paper looks at various issues with regard to
                  implementation of the Act in the state of Andhra
                  Pradesh. It investigates why the Act emerged in
                  relation to ap. It also reviews the range of forest
                  rights deprivations and how they came about. The

                  such a pro-poor institutional reform on the people

	Abstract = {The inadequate availability of drinking water and
                  proper sanitation, especially in rural India, leads
                  to innumerable deadly diseases, harms the
                  environment, and also affects vulnerable
                  populations, such as persons with disabilities and
                  women, exposing them to sexual violence. Providing
                  access to sanitation facilities in rural areas of
                  India has been on the agenda of the Government of
                  India for the past three decades. However, a
                  reinvigorated thrust to provide adequate sanitation
                  facilities in rural India is the need of the hour,
                  which must be accompanied by constant scrutiny and
                  monitoring, so as to arrive at apt decisions and
                  policies for further action. },

                  are taller. This gap can be fully accounted for by
                  differences in open defecation, and especially by

                  migrations have to be seen as forced. The labourers
                  remain in inter-kiln circulation, but are prevented
                  from moving on because of their limited skills and
                  social networks. They return home to repay a

                  for the next season--renewing a cycle of debt and

                  continues to be little appreciation that problems of
                  unemployment, poverty and destitution are in many
                  instances gender-specific so that any serious
                  attempt to alleviate these conditions and/or prevent
                  their further aggravation would require a particular
                  focus on the women of poor households. The accuracy
                  of national level statistics, which usually serve as
                  the principal data input in the framing of
                  development policies, is severely impaired by biases
                  which lead to an undercounting of women, both as
                  workers and as those available for work. This paper
                  seeks to spell out the nature and sources of these
                  data biases and attempts to provide pointers on how
                  they could be corrected and some of the data gaps
                  filled. },

	Year = 1999,
	Number = {1--2},

	Volume = 60,
	Abstract = {The combining of benefits for human nutrition and
                  agricultural productivity, resulting from breeding
                  staple food crops which are more efficient in the
                  micronutrient metal uptake from the soil, and which
                  accumulate more micronutrients into their seeds,
                  results in extremely high ex ante estimates of
                  benefit/costs ratios for investments in agricultural
                  research in this area. This finding derives from the
                  confluence of several complementary factors:* Rates
                  of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing
                  countries, as are the consequent costs to human
                  welfare and economic productivity. * Because staple
                  foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the
                  malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple foods
                  (fortified by the plants themselves during growth)
                  can rely on existing consumer behavior. * A
                  significant percentage of the soils in which these
                  staple foods are grown are `deficient' in these
                  micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields
                  low. In general, these soils in fact contain
                  relatively high total amounts of micronutrient
                  metals. However, because of binding to soil
                  constituents, these nutrients have poor soil
                  availability to staple crop varieties that are
                  currently available to farmers. * Adoption and
                  spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by
                  farmers can rely on profit incentives, either
                  because of agronomic advantages on trace
                  mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of
                  nutritional improvements in the most productive
                  varieties being released by agricultural research
                  stations. * Benefits to relatively small investments
                  in agricultural research may be disseminated widely,
                  potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of
                  people and millions of hectares of cropland. *
                  Benefits from breeding advances, derived from
                  initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high
                  recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly
                  sustainable as long as an effective domestic
                  agricultural research infrastructure is
                  maintained. }

                  considering their food security situations. Findings
                  - Brazil has a high domestic consumption of
                  dry-beans, and exports are seen as a secondary
                  activity. However, its production is superior to
                  their domestic needs. Exports of Brazilian dry-beans
                  are generally volatile and unstable. Evidence
                  suggests that countries with serious problems of
                  child and population's malnutrition (e.g. India and
                  Angola) buy more Brazilian dry-beans. However, their
                  domestic consumptions are still low. Research
                  limitations/implications - This research based only
                  on exports of dry-bean is faced as a significant
                  limitation. Future studies adding other staple foods
                  commonly consumed by economically disadvantaged
                  populations may contribute to the investigation of
                  the role of Brazil against the need for food
                  security in developing countries and emerging
                  economies. Social implications - Social implications
                  are focussed in the pursuit of malnutrition decrease
                  in the populations of developing countries through
                  the consumption of nutritionally rich and
                  economically viable food, such as
                  dry-beans. Originality/value --The original value is
                  based on the analysis of Brazilian dry-beans
                  production and trades and its potential to
                  contribute to nutritional safety and food security
                  in developing countries.},

	Abstract = {Abstract About half of the world population suffers
                  from the malnutrition of iron, zinc, calcium, iodine
                  and selenium. Most of the major staple crops of the
                  world, such as rice, wheat, cassava, beans, sweet
                  potato, pearl millet or maize are often deficient in
                  some of these mineral elements. Hence, increasing
                  the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients in
                  edible crop tissues (biofortification) has become a
                  promising strategy in modern agriculture, allowing
                  the access of more nutritious foods, to more people,
                  with the use of fewer resources. Traditional
                  agricultural practices can partly enhance the
                  nutritional value of plant foods, but the advances
                  in the `omics' technologies are rapidly being
                  exploited to engineer crops with enhanced key
                  nutrients. Ionomics, or the study of the ionome
                  (which can be defined as the mineral trace element
                  composition of a particular organism), is a modern
                  functional genomics tool that can provide high
                  throughput information about the broad spectrum
                  nutrient composition of a given plant food. In
                  alliance with other `omics' technologies, such as
                  genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics it can be
                  used to identify numerous genes with important roles
                  in the uptake, transport and accumulation of mineral
                  nutrients in plant foods, in particular in their
                  edible parts. This review provides a critical
                  comparison of the strategies that have been
                  developed to diminish nutrient deficiencies in
                  plant-based foods (SWOT analysis) and a summary of
                  the gene families involved in the mineral nutrient
                  pathways. Finally, it also discusses how `omics'
                  techniques can be used in genetic engineering
                  programs to increase mineral levels and
                  bioavailability in the most important staple food
                  crops and the socioeconomic implications of
                  plant-based biofortified foods. },

                  of the health service system in India. Tax-funded
                  insurance for poor families is the method chosen for
                  attaining this objective. The Rashtriya Swasthya
                  Bima Yojana was rolled out in 2008 for households
                  below the poverty line, enabling them to access
                  health services in the public and private
                  sectors. However, experience from different
                  countries shows tax-funded insurance systems work
                  well only in settings where public provisioning of
                  healthcare services prevails. State-funded targeted
                  insurance schemes do not seriously mitigate
                  inequitable access to health services in a
                  fundamentally private healthcare delivery market.},

                  inequality approach to health inequalities. It then
                  presents an alternative class-based model through a
                  focus on the causes and not only the consequences of
                  income inequalities. In this model, the relationship
                  between income inequality and health appears as a
                  special case within a broader causal chain. It is
                  argued that global and national
                  socio-political-economic trends have increased the
                  power of business classes and lowered that of
                  working classes. The neo-liberal policies
                  accompanying these trends led to increased income
                  inequality but also poverty and unequal access to
                  many other health-relevant resources. But
                  international pressures towards neo-liberal
                  doctrines and policies are differentially resisted
                  by various nations because of historically embedded
                  variation in class and institutional
                  structures. Data presented indicates that
                  neo-liberalism is associated with greater poverty
                  and income inequalities, and greater health
                  inequalities within nations. Furthermore, countries
                  with Social Democratic forms of welfare regimes
                  (i.e., those that are less neo-liberal) have better
                  health than do those that are more neo-liberal. The
                  paper concludes with discussion of what further
                  steps are needed to ‘go beyond’ the income
                  inequality hypothesis towards consideration of a
                  broader set of the social determinants of health.}

	abstract = { The mapping and analysis of supply chains is a
                  technique increasingly used to address problems in
                  the food system. Yet such supply chain management
                  has not yet been applied as a means of encouraging
                  healthier diets. Moreover, most policies recommended
                  to promote healthy eating focus on the consumer end
                  of the chain. This article proposes a
                  consumption-oriented food supply chain analysis to
                  identify the changes needed in the food supply chain
                  to create a healthier food environment, measured in
                  terms of food availability, prices, and
                  marketing. Along with established forms of supply
                  chain analysis, the method is informed by a
                  historical overview of how food supply chains have
                  changed over time. The method posits that the actors
                  and actions in the chain are affected by
                  organizational, financial, technological, and policy
                  incentives and disincentives, which can in turn be
                  levered for change. It presents a preliminary
                  example of the supply of Coca-Cola beverages into
                  school vending machines and identifies further
                  potential applications. These include fruit and
                  vegetable supply chains, local food chains, supply
                  chains for health-promoting versions of food
                  products, and identifying financial incentives in
                  supply chains for healthier eating. }

	year = 2008,
	abstract = {A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet
                  quality follows a socioeconomic gradient. Whereas
                  higher-quality diets are associated with greater
                  affluence, energy-dense diets that are nutrient-poor
                  are preferentially consumed by persons of lower
                  socioeconomic status (SES) and of more limited
                  economic means. As this review demonstrates, whole
                  grains, lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products,
                  and fresh vegetables and fruit are more likely to be
                  consumed by groups of higher SES. In contrast, the
                  consumption of refined grains and added fats has
                  been associated with lower SES. Although
                  micronutrient intake and, hence, diet quality are
                  affected by SES, little evidence indicates that SES
                  affects either total energy intakes or the
                  macronutrient composition of the diet. The observed
                  associations between SES variables and diet-quality
                  measures can be explained by a variety of
                  potentially causal mechanisms. The disparity in
                  energy costs between energy-dense and nutrient-dense
                  foods is one such mechanism; easy physical access to
                  low-cost energy-dense foods is another. If higher
                  SES is a causal determinant of diet quality, then
                  the reported associations between diet quality and
                  better health, found in so many epidemiologic
                  studies, may have been confounded by unobserved
                  indexes of social class. Conversely, if limited
                  economic resources are causally linked to
                  low-quality diets, some current strategies for
                  health promotion, based on recommending high-cost
                  foods to low-income people, may prove to be wholly
                  ineffective. Exploring the possible causal relations
                  between SES and diet quality is the purpose of this
                  review.},

	Volume = 43,
	Abstract = {National Sample Survey data on the unit values of a
                  large number of foods can be used to compute price
                  index numbers that can be compared with the official
                  national price indices, the Consumer Price Index for
                  Agricultural Labourers for rural India, and the
                  Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers for
                  urban India. This paper finds that over the five
                  years from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, the food component
                  of the cpial understated the rate of food price
                  inflation. This understatement can be attributed to
                  the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and
                  the resultant over-weighting of cereals, whose
                  prices fell relative to other foods. The overall
                  weight of food in the cpial is also too large, so
                  that the growth in the general cpial was understated
                  during this period when food prices fell relative to
                  non-food prices. Under conservative assumptions, the
                  paper calculates that the five-year growth in the
                  reported cpial of 10.6 per cent should have been
                  14.3 per cent. The nominal poverty lines are also
                  understated. As a result, and ignoring other
                  problems with the counts, the official poverty ratio
                  of 28.3 per cent for rural India in 2004-05 should
                  be closer to 31 per cent; at current rates of rural
                  poverty reduction, this eliminates more than three
                  years of progress.},

                  there was something amiss with our statistics of
                  irrigation potential, developed over the plans
                  through public, private and institutional
                  investments, arose time and again during the course
                  of innumerable probings by academic persons into the
                  problem of underutilisation of irrigation capacity
                  in {I}ndia. Misgivings about their being on the high
                  side were reinforced whenever the reported estimates
                  of irrigation potential utilised were compared by
                  some scholars with data from alternative
                  sources. For example, these estimates have tended to
                  exceed the levels based on our agricultural land
                  records. At the end of the Sixth Five- Ycar Plan (i
                  e, 1984-85), the national plan figure of gross
                  irrigated area was placed at 60.58 mha, almost 6 mha
                  more than the corresponding figure of 54.67 mha as
                  per the compilation from land utilisation
                  records. More up-to-date comparison is not possible
                  because data from land record sources are available
                  with a lag of 4-5 year period. In viewof this lag
                  planners are forced to rely on data in respect of
                  plan achievements (in respect of irrigation
                  potential created and utilised) as per the reports
                  of the states which in turn, go by the claims made
                  in this regard by their irrigation departments
                  manned mostly by engineers. },

                  irrigation has reached disturbing levels in many
                  states, notably UP. Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil
                  Nadu. But the less known volumetric statistics in
                  respect of groundwater irrigation compiled at the
                  behest of the Central Groundwater Board are rather
                  reassuring. Barring a dozen districts of the West
                  Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to
                  have reached the danger mark of groundwater
                  over-exploitation. The reality is somewhere between
                  these extremes, more likely nearer to the Board's
                  than the Commission's assessment. },

                  probably because hidden costs of corruption and
                  sheer inefficiencies in canal development and

	abstract = {Highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the United
                  States are found among the lower-income groups. The
                  observed links between obesity and socioeconomic
                  position may be related to dietary energy density
                  and energy cost. Refined grains, added sugars, and
                  added fats are among the lowest-cost sources of
                  dietary energy. They are inexpensive, good tasting,
                  and convenient. In contrast, the more nutrient-dense
                  lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit
                  generally cost more. An inverse relationship between
                  energy density of foods (kilojoules per gram) and
                  their energy cost (dollars per megajoule) means that
                  the more energy-dense diets are associated with
                  lower daily food consumption costs and may be an
                  effective way to save money. However, economic
                  decisions affecting food choice may have physiologic
                  consequences. Laboratory studies suggest that
                  energy-dense foods and energy-dense diets have a
                  lower satiating power and may result in passive
                  overeating and therefore weight gain. Epidemiologic
                  analyses suggest that the low-cost energy-dense
                  diets also tend to be nutrient poor. If the rise in
                  obesity rates is related to the growing price
                  disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods, then
                  the current strategies for obesity prevention may
                  need to be revised. Encouraging low-income families
                  to consume healthier but more costly foods to
                  prevent future disease can be construed as an
                  elitist approach to public health. Limiting access
                  to inexpensive foods through taxes on frowned upon
                  fats and sweets is a regressive measure. The broader
                  problem may lie with growing disparities in incomes
                  and wealth, declining value of the minimum wage,
                  food imports, tariffs, and trade. Evidence is
                  emerging that obesity in America is a largely
                  economic issue.},

                  distinguishes the present study from previous
                  investigations is that this analysis recognises the
                  joint endogeneity of child labour, child schooling
                  and child poverty. The study is conducted on
                  Nepalese and Pakistani data, and the results are
                  compared. A key empirical finding, with significant
                  policy implications, is the sharp trade-off between
                  child labour and child schooling. Another common
                  feature of both countries is the gender bias in
                  favour of boys' schooling, though the bias is much

                  indigenous lentils show a marked lack of
                  variability. This results from its introduction from
                  Afghanistan around 2000 B.C. and it limits breeding
                  progress. Three approaches to widening the genetic
                  base in the region have been tried, namely plant
                  introduction, hybridization and mutation
                  breeding. Introductions from West Asia flower as
                  indigenous material matures. The asynchrony in
                  flowering has isolated the local pilosae ecotype
                  reproductively. However, the introduction of ILL
                  4605, an early, large-seeded line, has resulted in
                  its release as `Manserha 89' for wetter areas of
                  Pakistan and its widespread use as a parent in
                  breeding programs in the region. Hybridization
                  between pilosae and exotic germplasm, primarily at
                  International Center for Agricultural Research in
                  the Dry Areas (ICARDA) followed by selection in the
                  sub-continent has resulted in cultivars with
                  improved disease resistance and yield in Bangladesh
                  and Pakistan. Mutation breeding has given new
                  morphological markers and several promising
                  lines. These examples illustrate not only the
                  widening of the genetic base of the lentil in South
                  Asia, but also the evolution of a breeding program
                  of an international center and national programs
                  targeted toward specific adaptation.},

                  authors identified more than 120 cash transfer
                  programs that were implemented between 2000 and
                  mid-2009 in Sub-Saharan Africa. These programs have
                  varying objectives, targeting, scale, conditions,
                  technologies, and more. A sizable number of these
                  programs conducted robust impact evaluations that
                  provide important information, presented here, on
                  the merits of cash transfer programs and their
                  specific design features in the African context. The
                  authors present summary information on programs,
                  often in useful graphs, and provide detailed
                  reference material in the appendixes. They highlight
                  how many of the cash transfer programs in Africa
                  that had not yet begun implementation at the time of
                  writing will continue to provide important
                  evaluation results that will guide the design of
                  cash transfer programs in the region. In addition to
                  presenting data and analysis on the mechanics of the
                  programs, the authors discuss issues related to
                  political economy. They highlight the importance of
                  addressing key tradeoffs in cash transfers,
                  political will, and buy-in, and they emphasize the
                  need to build evidence-based debates on cash
                  transfer programs. Useful anecdotes and discussion
                  illustrate how some programs have dealt with these
                  issues with varying degrees of success. This text
                  will serve as a useful reference for years to come
                  for those interested in large- and small-scale
                  issues of cash transfer implementation, both in
                  Africa and beyond. However, the book is not an end
                  in itself. It also raises important questions that
                  must be addressed and knowledge gaps that must be
                  filled. Therefore, it is useful both in the
                  information it provides and in the issues and
                  questions it raises.},

	abstract = {The demand for milk and milk products is rapidly
                  increasing with achievement of high economic growth
                  in India. Chances that demand growth will surpass
                  the output growth are high. In the past, substantial
                  increment in production was achieved with the
                  implementation of a comprehensive dairy development
                  programme operation flood. It is contented that the
                  future increase in milk production will have to be
                  met by increasing the productivity of dairy
                  animals. However, productivity augmentations are
                  difficult to come by in the given
                  circumstances. While proposing that greater
                  availability of concentrate feeds was primarily
                  responsible for improved production in the past, it
                  is opined that available technology is of limited
                  use in supporting future productivity
                  improvement. Similarly, genetic improvement of
                  animals, which was largely responsible for milk
                  production increases in the past, will prove
                  contentious. Constraints in the supply of feed and
                  fodder are also highlighted. Hindrances in the
                  delivery of veterinary support services, which are
                  likely to play a crucial role, are outlined. Lack of
                  research and development support and adequate market
                  access to smallholders as factors contributing to
                  the list of challenges are identified. Issues of
                  contemporary market failing to incentivise the
                  producers are highlighted besides identifying the
                  reasons for resistance to shift to neo-liberal
                  market structures. Finally, climate change, as
                  having direct and indirect adverse effects on the
                  production, is identified as a factor adding to the
                  complexity of situation. While seeking to analyse
                  the current challenges confronting the Indian dairy
                  sector in the face of imminent demand increases, it
                  is concluded that a multifaceted programme of the
                  nature and extent of operation flood is needed. It
                  is suggested that this will provide the much
                  required momentum to different components of the
                  milk production system.}

                  agricultural competitiveness. Both industries have
                  become more concentrated over time, with powerful
                  "lead firms" driving geographical, technological,
                  and marketing changes. Overall, a processed food
                  revolution has taken place in agricultural products
                  that transforms the types of food and dietary
                  options available to consumers. The nature of
                  contemporary food and agricultural value chains
                  affects the strategies and policies that can be

                  Discussion about the impact of the New Economic
                  Policy only casually refers to agricultural
                  labourers and their wages. Further, the methods of
                  wage data collection seem to have attracted
                  negligible attention of researchers and the
                  government agencies collecting and publishing such
                  data. The attitude of indifference also gets
                  reflected in the manner the problem of minimum wage
                  determination is handled. Though the labour unions
                  have done commendable work on this issue, they have
                  not been able to get a proper minimum wage
                  determined. Therefore, understanding various sources
                  of wage data and their respective methods of
                  collection is important to get qualitatively
                  reliable data. },

                  legitimacy by associating themselves with key
                  institutions and people. A prime example of this is

                  that are impossible to solve. In other words, the
                  range of complex interacting influences and effects;
                  the influence of human values in all their range;
                  and the constantly changing conditions in which the
                  problem exists guarantee that what we strive to do
                  is improve the situation rather than solve the
                  wicked problem. This does not mean that we cannot
                  move a long way toward resolving the problem but
                  simply that there is no clean endpoint. This
                  commentary outlines principles that could be used in
                  moving us toward a healthy food system within the
                  framework of it presenting as a wicked problem. }

                  voices from the health care sector have begun to

                  to articulate the urgency for engagement in food and
                  agricultural policy. Systemic transformation
                  requires a range of policies that complement one
                  another and address various aspects of the food
                  system. Health care involvement in policy and
                  advocacy is vital to solve the expanding ecological
                  health crises facing our nation and globe and will

                  perspective, based on the work of the HOPE
                  Collaborative in Oakland, California. The HOPE
                  Collaborative initiated intensive community outreach
                  and engagement as part of its planning process to
                  address inequitable access to healthy food in
                  Oakland's most vulnerable neighborhoods. This effort
                  involved two levels of community assessment and an
                  inquiry into the potential of addressing both
                  healthy food access and poverty through the
                  construction of local food enterprise networks. Many
                  unanswered questions remain. However, it seems clear
                  in that in order to reduce health disparities in
                  Oakland's most vulnerable neighborhoods, the
                  community must address inequities in both access to
                  healthy food and access to economic opportunity. }

	Abstract = {This paper re-examines the trends in employment and
                  unemployment as thrown up by successive National
                  Sample Surveys from the mid-1970s. The analysis
                  suggests that the euphoria about high employment
                  growth during 1999-2004 was not justified nor does
                  the concern about jobless growth in the subsequent
                  years capture the changes in employment structure. A
                  long-term analysis of employment trends reveals that
                  changes in the employment pattern and workforce
                  structure have been sluggish and do not conform to
                  the standard employment-output relationship. The
                  analysis also flags certain issues which have a
                  bearing on the comparability of employment data
                  before and after 1993-94. Large fluctuations seen
                  after 1993-94 appear to be a result of the movement
                  in and out of labour force of a substantial section
                  of the population which is vulnerable and in the
                  informal sector in a phase of rising overall rates
                  of economic growth. The paper concludes with a brief
                  discussion of the results of the recently released
                  2009-10 survey.},

	Abstract = {Trends in employment and unemployment in India, as
                  presented by the quinquennial surveys of the
                  National Sample Survey Office for the past decades,
                  have raised many questions for which there are no
                  easy answers. This paper attempts to address some
                  missing links. With the help of time use statistics,
                  it argues that the missing labour force does not
                  imply withdrawal of women (and maybe some men) from
                  the labour market. A large part of the missing
                  labour is missing only from the NSSO data but is
                  very much there in the labour force - though a small
                  part may be due to withdrawal. It appears "missing"
                  because of the inability of the NSSO surveys to
                  capture it adequately. This "non-missing labour
                  force" has important implications for the employment
                  and labour policy in the country. The paper also
                  argues that time use statistics has the potential of
                  overcoming some weaknesses of the NSSO as well as of
                  adding new information on the labour force.},

	Abstract = {Any discussion on universal health coverage in India
                  is premature without a comprehensive understanding
                  of public financing of health coverage in the
                  country. This article analyses the government's
                  share of financial resources for health across
                  different agents, with particular focus on resources
                  for health coverage. An attempt is made to separate
                  spending for health in general and health coverage
                  in particular, and to examine the issue of
                  equity. The analysis indicates that the present
                  health coverage system is inadequate and iniquitous,
                  with various systems running at different costs. It
                  suggests consolidating finances and moving towards a
                  more unified system to realise the benefits of
                  efficiency gains.},

                  a research project on Gender and Migration at the

                  results of a series of primary surveys conducted
                  between 2009 and 2011 across 20 states have been
                  consolidated to present a summary meso-level view of
                  types of migration, patterns of female labour
                  migration, conditions of work and civic life of
                  women migrant workers. The sectoral composition of
                  paid migrant workers based on the latest available
                  migration survey by the National Sample Survey
                  Office is presented for contextual background,
                  alongside a critical interrogation of the official
                  data's gender insensitive concepts. Rising rates of
                  marriage migration juxtaposed against falling female
                  work participation rates and the spread of dowry are
                  also touched upon. },

                  support the American farm economy. Over time,
                  however, it has evolved into a system that creates
                  substantial health impacts, both directly and
                  indirectly. By generating more profit for food
                  producers and less for family farmers; by
                  effectively subsidizing the production of lower-cost
                  fats, sugars, and oils that intensify the
                  health-destroying obesity epidemic; by amplifying
                  environmentally destructive agricultural practices
                  that impact air, water, and other resources, the
                  Farm Bill influences the health of Americans more
                  than is immediately apparent. In this article, we
                  outline three major public health issues influenced
                  by American farm policy. These are (1) rising
                  obesity; (2) food safety; and (3) environmental
                  health impacts, especially exposure to toxic
                  substances and pesticides. }

                  growth in rural non-farm employment based on the
                  2009-10 employment and unemployment round of the
                  National Sample Survey Office. The rural non-farm
                  sector has undergone major restructuring which has
                  led to an increase in the share of casual labour in
                  the non-farm sector accompanied by a continuous
                  decline in the share of self and regular
                  employment. On the basis of multivariate analyses at
                  two levels, this study concludes that though
                  non-farm employment in rural areas is primarily
                  distress-driven, there are some significant entry
                  barriers for rural workers in the nonfarm sector in
                  terms of education, age and gender. Considering the
                  overall deceleration of rural employment until
                  2009-10, the paper emphasises the importance of
                  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
                  Scheme in rural employment generation and the
                  consequent process of feminisation of casual
                  workforce in the non-farm sector that has emerged in
                  the last five years. The results indicate the crisis
                  of joblessness would have been more acute without
                  the scheme. The overall quality of rural employment,
                  driven by distress factors, has deteriorated in
                  2009-10 over 2004-05 in a significant way. },

                  sub-sector of the {I}ndian economy accelerated
                  during the second half of the 2000s, compared to the
                  first half of the decade. However, employment growth
                  in most sectors except construction
                  decelerated. This jobless growth was partly the
                  result of positive changes such as the reduction of
                  &quot;distress employment&quot; in agriculture,
                  created during the previous half-decade, and an
                  expansion in the population of students. Rural wages
                  rose and average educational levels of the workforce
                  improved. Government interventions in rural {I}ndia
                  since the mid-2000s, particularly the Mahatma Gandhi
                  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, seemed to
                  have aided these positive transformations. However,
                  manufacturing employment in the country fell and
                  employment growth slowed down in most constituents
                  of the services sector. The new jobs generated were
                  predominantly in rural construction. The slow
                  progress in the diversification of {I}ndia&#39;s
                  employment structure has led to large-scale
                  withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the
                  number of women thus &quot;missing&quot; being as
                  large as the population of Brazil. },

                  2011-12 indicate that employment generation in the
                  country has been inadequate to meet this
                  challenge. Construction has virtually become the

                  worldwide - remain chronically hungry. Ending hunger
                  and malnutrition requires strong political
                  commitment at the highest level, effective
                  coordination among various ministries and partners,
                  and broad-based social participation. Three policy
                  priorities are crucial to ending malnutrition -
                  expansion of social protection; making smallholder
                  agriculture more nutrition sensitive; and focusing
                  on under-fi ve child and maternal nutrition defi
                  ciencies. An integrated approach is needed to ensure
                  that food consumed is nutritious, wholesome,
                  acceptable, safe and affordable, especially to the
                  poorest and most vulnerable.},

                  in Sub-Saharan Africa and, far from decreasing, the
                  proportion and numbers of poor people in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa have actually increased over the last ten
                  years. Policies to reduce poverty in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa (SSA) and elsewhere are defying conventional
                  wisdom. Single-focus solutions have proved
                  ineffective. There is an urgent need to learn from
                  both successful and failed experiences that have
                  been tried elsewhere. This study provides an ex-ante
                  assessment of the implementation of a cash transfer
                  programme conditional on school attendance in 15
                  Sub-Saharan African countries. Conditional cash
                  transfer (CCT) programmes have been tried in other
                  regions, notably Latin America, with relative
                  success. The two key characteristics of CCT
                  programmes are that they simultaneously act upon the
                  short and long term dimensions of poverty. Therefore
                  we investigate here both the impact of a cash
                  transfer on current poverty and the impact of
                  conditioning the transfer upon school attendance.},

@article{kelly1953,
	Abstract = {Contributions made by five groups of investigators
                  to the knowledge of the stability of different
                  iodine compounds in salt, and of the extent of the
                  losses of iodine which may occur when iodized salt
                  is exposed to different conditions of storage and
                  use, are discussed by the author. Stability of the
                  iodine component in iodized salt is determined by:
                  (1) moisture content of the salt and humidity of the
                  atmosphere; (2) light, heat, and other
                  meteorological factors; (3) impurities in the salt;
                  (4) acidity or alkalinity of the mixture; and (5)
                  the form in which iodine is present. When potassium
                  iodide or sodium iodide is used as the iodizing
                  agent, the iodide content of the salt will remain
                  constant and its distribution will remain uniform
                  for many months if the salt is packed dry in a
                  container with an impervious lining and kept dry,
                  preferably in a cool place and away from strong
                  light. When these conditions cannot be met, it is
                  desirable to iodize salt with potassium
                  iodate. Under adverse conditions of moisture, heat,
                  and sunlight, the iodine content of salt iodized
                  with potassium iodate remains relatively constant.},

                  diverted from the public distribution system to the
                  open market in the past decade by matching official
                  offtake figures with household purchase reported by
                  the National Sample Survey. At the all-India level,
                  diversion of pds grain remains a serious issue;
                  however there are interesting contrasts at the state
                  level. Based on trends in monthly per capita
                  purchase of pds grain and estimated diversion,
                  states are categorised into three groups -
                  "functioning", "reviving" and "languishing"
                  states. The paper also discusses the possible
                  reasons for the improvement in the pds in the
                  reviving states and questions the assessment of the
                  pds as uniformly and irreversibly dysfunctional.},

                  evaluation and other studies of IRDP show that a
                  very small percentage of the intended beneficiaries
                  have succeeded in deriving any real benefit In all
                  probability the successful cases are those who
                  belong to the better off categories and who are
                  really not eligible for the scheme WHEN the
                  Integrated Rural Development Programme was launched
                  with great fanfare it was thought that something
                  spectacular was going to happen in rural India. But
                  it turned out to be a miserable scheme of giving
                  loans to the poor with an element of subsidy for
                  some small asset like a buffalo. In the beginning
                  the poor were not even aware of it and better-off
                  farmers got the buffaloes in the name of their
                  servants who were just asked to affix their
                  signature/thumb impression on the application
                  form. There were cases when corrupt lower
                  functionaries at the block level misappropriated the
                  loan on the basis of fake applications. When the
                  racket assumed serious proportions it became
                  mandatory to affix a photograph of the applicant but
                  this did not end the mischief In rural areas there
                  are indigent persons who need small sums to meet
                  their daily requirements or to repay small
                  consumption loans. A small amount used to be paid to
                  them for signing the application form; the loan
                  amount would be withdrawn; the subsidy, usually
                  331/3 per cent of the loan, would be pocketed and
                  the rest paid back to the bank. Thus targets were
                  fulfilled and the recovery was cent per cent as also
                  speedy and the corrupt village development officer
                  (VDO) would get approbation for overfulfilment of
                  targets and more importantly for quick recovery of
                  loans. Incidentally, VDOs were previously known as
                  'gram sewaks', i.e, village servants. They resented
                  being called 'gram sewaks' and considered it
                  derogatory. They agitated for a change in their
                  designation and now they are known as village
                  development officers. One can understand the
                  commitment of such functionaries who have descended
                  on the rural areas.},

                  strategies employed by privately-owned companies to
                  gain access to land for resource extraction in
                  Jharkhand where much of the land being put under the
                  shovel is inalienable adivasi or tribal land and
                  deedless commons. It concludes that although policy
                  reforms are welcome, cosmetic changes in mineral
                  governance laws are inadequate to protect the
                  interests of the poor. It suggests an alternative
                  vision, a complete overhaul of mineral ownership to
                  allow the poor to share the revenue benefits.},

                  paper describes patterns of job-seeking, rationing,
                  and participation in the Mahatma Gandhi National
                  Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. At the national
                  level, it finds that the self-targeting design of
                  MGNREGS leads to greater rates of self-selection
                  into the programme by poorer and scheduled tribe or
                  scheduled caste households. However, the
                  administrative rationing of MGNREGS jobs is not
                  pro-poor but exhibits a sort of middle-class
                  bias. At the state level, roughly half of 27 states
                  exhibit rationing and participation profiles that
                  signal effective pro-poor targeting; the other half
                  struggle to avoid high rates and regressive patterns
                  of administrative rationing of jobs to which the
                  poor have a legal right. },

                  convened in April 2009 to consider research
                  supporting food systems that are healthy, green,
                  fair, and affordable. We used a complex systems
                  framework to examine the contents of background
                  material provided to conference
                  participants. Application of our intervention-level
                  framework (paradigm, goals, system structure,
                  feedback and delays, structural elements) enabled
                  comparison of the conference themes of healthy,
                  green, fair, and affordable. At the level of system
                  structure suggested actions to achieve these goals
                  are fairly compatible, including broad public
                  discussion and implementation of policies and
                  programs that support sustainable food production
                  and distribution. At the level of paradigm and
                  goals, the challenge of making healthy and green
                  food affordable becomes apparent as some actions may
                  be in conflict. Systems thinking can provide insight
                  into the challenges and opportunities to act to make
                  the food supply more healthy, green, fair, and
                  affordable. }

                  future and a diversification away from over-reliance
                  on staples will be important as part of the progress
                  towards the goal of achieving security of food
                  production. Underutilized or neglected crops species
                  are often indigenous ancient crop species which are
                  still used at some level within the local, national
                  or even international communities, but have the
                  potential to contribute further to the mix of food
                  sources than they currently do. The most
                  cost-effective and easily disseminated changes that
                  can be made to a crop are changes to the genetics,
                  as these are contained within the seed itself and,
                  for many species, the seed is a pure breeding,

                  the potential of underutilized crops to contribute
                  to food security and, in particular, whether
                  genetics and breeding can overcome some of the
                  constraints to the enhanced uptake of these species
                  in the future. The focus here is on overview rather
                  than detail and subsequent articles will examine the

                  additional tool to combat micronutrient
                  malnutrition. This paper estimates the costs and
                  potential benefits of biofortification of globally
                  important staple food crops with provitamin A, iron,
                  and zinc for twelve countries in Africa, Asia, and
                  Latin America. Using a modification of the
                  Disability-Adjusted Life Years framework we conclude
                  that overall, the intervention can make a
                  significant impact on the burden of micronutrient
                  deficiencies in the developing world in a highly
                  cost-effective manner. Results differ by crop,
                  micronutrient, and country; and major reasons
                  underlying these differences are identified to
                  inform policy. }

	Abstract = {India witnessed a widening of income inequality
                  during the phase of acceleration in economic growth
                  in the post-reform period (1993-94 to 2004-05). This
                  paper analyses the issue by using different types of
                  inequality measurements like general entropy
                  indices, kernel density graphs, percentile of income
                  graphs and field decomposition. It finds two major
                  features of a rising inequality in urban areas: (a)
                  even with a doubling of per capita consumption
                  growth in the post-reform decade, the decline in
                  poverty was less by a quarter compared to the
                  pre-reform decade, and (b) in the post-reform
                  period, the growth of the wage rate of regular
                  workers was negative up to the 50th percentile of
                  wage earnings, and beyond that point, wage rate
                  growth turned positive and rose sharply to reach 5\%
                  per annum in highest quintile of wage earnings. },

                  issues in the computation of the prevalence of
                  inadequate calorie intakes in India using NSS
                  data. It focuses on the setting of appropriate norms
                  or cutoffs which determine adequacy or inadequacy,
                  as well as the measurement of intakes. Although
                  energy norms for an individual are biologically
                  determined their use as a policy tool necessitates
                  several additional considerations that have not
                  received sufficient attention in the literature. We
                  demonstrate that changes in assumptions regarding
                  age-sex distribution, average heights of adults, and
                  physical activity status can lead to substantial
                  changes in norms. Also important is the way food
                  intakes are measured: changes in food habits that
                  may lead to greater underreporting as the recall
                  period increases, and the increasing trend, even
                  though small, of eating meals outside the home, can
                  exert a significant influence on the trends in the
                  POU over time. With more realistic assumptions, the
                  prevalence of inadequate energy intakes are quite
                  reasonable in magnitude, although still high in
                  absolute terms. The paper also suggests that by
                  accounting for outliers, there is a correlation
                  between anthropometric indicators for adults and
                  food intakes.},

	abstract = { Economies of size refer to the ability of a farm to
                  lower costs of production by increasing
                  production. Agriculture production displays an
                  L-shaped average cost curve where costs are lower
                  initially but reach a point where no further gains
                  are achieved. Spreading fixed costs, bulk purchases,
                  and marketing power are cited as reasons for
                  economies of size. Labor-reducing technologies may
                  be the primary reason. Most studies do not include
                  the external costs from prophylactic antibiotic use,
                  impact on rural communities, and environmental
                  damage associated with large-scale production. These
                  can contribute to the economies of size. }

                  disadvantaged in respect to land, which largely
                  accounts for their perpetual poverty and makes them
                  vulnerable to injustice and exploitation, attempts
                  have been made by the union and state governments to
                  promote and protect their rights with regard to the
                  control and use of land. Based on 13 major states,
                  the present study shows that even after 50 years of
                  planned initiatives and policy measures, there has
                  not been substantial improvement in the landholding
                  status of scheduled groups, and in some states, it
                  has declined further.},

	Volume = 36,
	Abstract = {Public distribution of foodgrains in India is a
                  national policy, which exists in all states. In some
                  states, however, the public distribution system
                  (PDS) works much better than in other states. The
                  undivided state of Bihar (now the new Bihar and
                  Jharkhand) is one of the states in which the policy
                  works poorly. It is important to understand why this
                  is the case. Generally, policy changes and
                  recommendations do not take the specificities of
                  particular states into account. Yet, for the PDS
                  performance to improve in Bihar and Jharkhand, it is
                  absolutely necessary to understand why it works as
                  it does, what the main bottlenecks are and where
                  there are possibilities for improvement, if
                  any. This paper makes such an attempt: it describes
                  the PDS in Bihar and Jharkhand, not only in terms of
                  how it fails and what it does not accomplish, but
                  also in terms of what it is and what it does. It is
                  shown that while many people do benefit from the
                  present set-up, there are also people within almost
                  all categories of stakeholders who are dissatisfied
                  with the large-scale misappropriation of
                  foodgrains. It is argued that there is scope for
                  change, but change requires strategic political
                  manoeuvring and initially a low-key approach in
                  order not to awaken and antagonise strong vested
                  interests.},

                  rainfed village in the Vidarbha region of
                  Maharashtra, {I}ndia. While the pros and cons of GM
                  cotton are extensively debated, there are only a few
                  empirical studies on the economic performance of Bt
                  cotton, particularly under rainfed conditions. The
                  results from a detailed survey of farm business
                  incomes show that Bt cotton was a clear leader in
                  terms of production and gross value of output when
                  grown as a stand-alone crop. However, on the fields
                  of small and marginal farmers, where cotton was
                  usually intercropped with sorghum (or other cereals
                  and pulses), the relative income advantage of Bt
                  cotton declined. Further, expenditure on chemical
                  pesticides was higher for Bt cotton than for other
                  varieties of cotton. Variability in production was
                  also higher for Bt cotton than for other types of

                  food and agricultural policy provides tremendous
                  opportunities for advancing the public's health. It
                  is particularly challenging, however, for
                  professionals to understand and consider the
                  numerous policy drivers that impact the food system,
                  which range from agricultural commodity policies to
                  local food safety ordinances. Confronted with this
                  complexity in the food system, policy advocates
                  often focus on narrow objectives with disregard for
                  the larger system. This commentary contends that, in
                  order to be most effective, public health
                  professionals need to consider the full range of
                  interdependent policies that affect the system. Food
                  policy councils have proven to be an effective tool,
                  particularly at the local and state level, for
                  developing comprehensive food systems policies that
                  can improve public health. }

                  2007, which was meant to protect poor families from

                  out that the need is to formulate a state health
                  policy, which, among other things, targets a
                  government health expenditure to total health

	Abstract = {For the last decade or two, an interesting debate
                  has been in progress over the definition of child
                  labour and child work and the contribution of
                  children's work in the informal economy. Those who
                  have argued for a narrow definition have been
                  motivated in part by the desire to reduce the size
                  of the problem and thus make it more manageable. But
                  this conceptual sleight-of-hand flies in the face of
                  common sense and results in making the work of
                  millions of children invisible to public policy and
                  public action. This paper argues that the
                  distinction at the conceptual level between child
                  labour and child work is essentially flawed. It
                  revisits some of the empirical questions around this
                  distinction and concludes that such a distinction be
                  abandoned both at the level of theory and practice.

                  specific attention to social and cultural variables
                  could overturn standard assumptions regarding
                  women's employment, which indeed has relevance for
                  more general discussions on employment in the
                  country.},

	abstract = { The United States has set a national goal to
                  eliminate health disparities. This article
                  emphasizes the importance of food systems in
                  generating and exacerbating health disparities in
                  the United States and suggests avenues for reducing
                  them. It presents a conceptual model showing how
                  broad food system conditions interplay with
                  community food environments--and how these
                  relationships are filtered and refracted through
                  prisms of social disparities to generate and
                  exacerbate health disparities. Interactions with
                  demand factors in the social environment are
                  described. The article also highlights the separate
                  food systems pathway to health disparities via
                  environmental and occupational health effects of
                  agriculture. }

	Abstract = {This paper analyses National Sample survey data on
                  changes in the distribution of operational holdings
                  of land, using data from NSS surveys on employment
                  and unemployment. The paper discusses the
                  limitations of these statistics in some detail. Four
                  main points emerge from the analysis: there has been
                  a sharp rise in landlessness in rural {I}ndia; caste
                  disparities in access to land have persisted over
                  time; there has been a rise in inequality in
                  distribution of land cultivated by households; and
                  there has been a decline in the proportion of manual
                  labour households that combined wage labour with
                  cultivation of small holdings. Finally, statistics
                  on land distribution at the State level reveal some
                  puzzling features -- some of which point to possible
                  errors in data collection.},

                  errors that appeared in the print edition. A
                  comparison of the consumption expenditure and
                  associated nutritional intake data for 2009-10 with
                  that of 2004-05 shows worsening poverty in terms of
                  the percentage of people unable to reach the minimum
                  required calories energy intake through their
                  monthly spending on all goods and services. This
                  result must be seen in the context of neo-liberal
                  policy, the financial crisis and consequent global
                  recession affecting export production, the rapid
                  rise in food prices, declining employment growth,
                  the drought of 2009-10, and in spite of a positive
                  development like the National Rural Employment
                  Guarantee Scheme. It is argued that the decline
                  claimed in the official poverty ratios is spurious.

                  evidence, though a large majority of studies
                  reported that health tended to be worse in more
                  unequal societies. More recent studies, not included
                  in those reviews, provide substantial new
                  evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess
                  whether or not wider income differences play a
                  causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a
                  literature review within an epidemiological causal
                  framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal
                  relationship between income inequality and health
                  (including violence) by considering the evidence as
                  a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that
                  income inequality affects population health and
                  wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality,
                  biological plausibility, consistency and lack of
                  alternative explanations are well supported. Of the
                  small minority of studies which find no association,
                  most can be explained by income inequality being
                  measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of
                  mediating variables as controls, the use of
                  subjective rather than objective measures of health,
                  or follow up periods which are too short. The
                  evidence that large income differences have damaging
                  health and social consequences is strong and in most
                  countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the
                  gap will improve the health and wellbeing of
                  populations.}

	Abstract = {This paper explores the interrelationships in India
                  between economic growth, expanding employment
                  opportunities and the imperative of dramatically
                  reducing CO2 emissions. Specifically, it shows that
                  within a framework of economic growth, the Indian
                  economy can both expand employment opportunities for
                  workers, peasants and the poor while also reducing
                  CO2 emissions. The model assumes that India grows at
                  an average annual rate of 6.0% over a 20-year
                  period. Within this framework, it proposes that
                  India increase its annual total of public and
                  private investments in energy efficiency and clean
                  renewable energy sources by 1.5% of gross domestic
                  product. The paper finds that India will achieve
                  dramatic CO2 emissions reductions and generate major
                  gains in employment opportunities by undertaking
                  these clean energy investments, as opposed to
                  maintaining the economy's existing fossil-fuel based
                  energy infrastructure. India could accomplish these
                  goals while also eliminating entirely its reliance
                  on nuclear power.},

	Abstract = {The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
                  Education Act, 2009 promises free and compulsory
                  education to all children in the age group of 6-14
                  years. But the way this critical entitlement is
                  being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart
                  from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of
                  the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued
                  the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is
                  aimed at ushering in quality elementary education
                  for all. The problems are many, and this paper
                  observes that most of them can be connected to
                  inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of
                  ensuring that the Act&#39;s aims are fulfilled is to
                  bring in a common school system based on
                  neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering
                  variety of indifferent institutions we now have. },

	Abstract = {Canada has become a major producer and exporter of
                  pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris
                  Medikus). Production is concentrated in western
                  Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba), where
                  the grains industry has undergone a significant
                  change. Crop diversification, depressed prices for
                  traditional grains, along with the recent end of
                  transportation subsidies and production support
                  programs are factors in this change. Successes in
                  pulse crop research, commercial production, producer
                  group organization, and export markets has
                  encouraged the investigation and adoption of new
                  crops. In-country primary processing has expanded
                  rapidly to match increases in pulse crop production
                  and provide a consistent high quality
                  product. Adapted Rhizobium inoculant products have
                  been developed that assist in maintaining relatively
                  low input costs in pulse crop production. Pulse crop
                  research is a high priority for funding agencies and
                  producer groups. Diversification into chickpea
                  (Cicer arietinum L.) and dry bean (Phaseolus
                  vulgaris L) is poised to enter large-scale
                  commercial production.},

                  approach are needed to alleviate the problem of

                  regime of the 1970s and 1980s and after its
                  abolition in the 1990s, when economic reforms were

                  information collected as part of the "comprehensive
                  scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After
                  surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well
                  as costs of cultivation vis-{\`{a}}-vis the
                  wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price
                  level), the value of inputs which are exclusively
                  market-purchased are analysed. A study of the
                  weighted average of these costs establishes
                  unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs

	Abstract = {of "Intermediate Regimes" IN a paper published in
                  1964, Kalecki used the term "intermediate regimes"
                  to describe governments in which the lower-middle
                  class and the rich peasantry could be identified as
                  performing the role of the ruling class.1 In the
                  past, he observed, whenever social up- heavels
                  brought their representatives to power they had
                  invariably served the interests of big business
                  often allied with the remnants of the feudal
                  system. However, certain conditions had emerged
                  recently in many underdeveloped countries which made
                  it possible for them to play a different role. The
                  specific conditions he cited were: the numerical
                  dominance of the lower middle class at the time of
                  achievement of the political independence of these
                  countries, the extensive involvement of governments
                  in economic activity, and the availability to; them
                  of credits from socialist countries. Given these
                  conditions, the state could, in his view, perform
                  the role of 'dynamic entrepreneurs', undertake the
                  basic investment necessary for economic development,
                  and promote "a pattern of amalgamation of the
                  interests of the lower middle class with state
                  capitalism.},

	Year = 2012,
	Pages = {92-103},
	Volume = 43,
	Abstract = {Public investment in agriculture has significant
                  poverty-reducing effects. This article attempts to
                  analyse trends in agricultural investments in
                  {I}ndia between the 1950s and the 2000s. It argues
                  that public investment and expenditure on
                  agriculture in {I}ndia have grown only slowly and
                  have not decisively increased even after more than
                  60 years of independence. While public capital
                  formation and expenditure do show a moderate rise in
                  the 2000s, a revival of {I}ndia's agricultural
                  growth requires a far greater thrust to public
                  spending. Major and medium irrigation projects
                  require special attention, as irrigation is
                  instrumental not just in raising yields, but also
                  the number of days of employment for
                  labourers. Increasing public investment in
                  agricultural research and extension is central to
                  bridging the yield gap that persists. Formal credit
                  flows to agriculture have to specifically target
                  small and marginal farmers, and emphasis should move
                  away from generating agricultural growth by
                  channelling credit to agri-business firms and
                  corporate players in agriculture. If {I}ndia's
                  second green revolution has to contribute to an
                  accelerated reduction of poverty, hunger and
                  malnourishment, it undoubtedly has to be a state-led
                  project.},

                  lack of teachers affect the quality of teaching,
                  poverty is responsible for the alarming rates of
                  non-enrolment, dropouts and poor attendance of
                  pupils. Scheduled tribe children are particularly at
                  a disadvantage as education is not imparted in their
                  mother tongue. The state of primary education, as
                  this paper suggests, needs a multi-pronged effort to
                  ensure its greater effectiveness. While the
                  government can step in with incentives such as
                  midday meal schemes, community participation in the
                  governance of the primary schooling system has to be
                  ensured.},

                  strategy for delivering micronutrients to rural
                  populations in developing countries. Crops are being
                  bred for higher levels of micronutrients using both
                  conventional and transgenic breeding methods;
                  several conventional varieties have been released,
                  while additional conventional and transgenic
                  varieties are in the breeding pipeline. The results
                  of efficacy and effectiveness studies, as well as
                  recent successes in delivery, provide evidence that
                  biofortification is a promising strategy for
                  combating hidden hunger. This review highlights
                  progress to date and identifies challenges faced in
                  delivering biofortified crops. },

	Abstract = {The 55th round (1999-2000) of the NSS used a
                  different methodology from all previous rounds and
                  arrived at lower poverty estimates. The consensus
                  from earlier NSS rounds, that poverty reduction had
                  been set back during the 1990s, was challenged by
                  this data. This was bolstered by some 'adjustments',
                  which although agreeing that the 55th round had
                  overestimated poverty reduction, claimed that the
                  number of poor had nonetheless fallen by 30-45
                  million. However, a detailed re-examination shows
                  that these 'adjustments' were not correct. The
                  poverty ratio fell at most by 3 percentage points
                  between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, and it is likely that
                  the number of poor increased over this period. The
                  main lesson is that poverty estimates are very
                  sensitive to both survey design and post-survey
                  analysis. The first of a two-part article.},

	Volume = 48,
	Abstract = {This paper, in two parts, reports an evaluation of
                  existing in-kind food transfers. Part I outlines the
                  dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer
                  content and physical leakages, and deals with the
                  impact of these transfers on poverty as officially
                  measured. Part II reports the impact of these
                  transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some
                  issues regarding the financial cost of these
                  transfers. Contrary to the view that food
                  self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the
                  need for direct food interventions, the paper
                  reports a significant increase in contribution of
                  in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and
                  nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact
                  is attributable to improved public distribution
                  system efficiency. The first part, presented here,
                  was motivated by some issues that arose in the
                  context of the Tendulkar method of estimating
                  poverty as regards its treatment of food
                  prices. This method treats food prices differently
                  from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive
                  to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper
                  suggests a decomposition method that modifies the
                  Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between
                  household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers
                  received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty
                  reducing impact of these food transfers is found to
                  have increased over time and is more pronounced in
                  the case of distribution-sensitive measures of
                  poverty. },

                  on nutritional intake as measured by
                  calories. Econometric analysis using a simple
                  calorie demand function confirms the significance of
                  variables relating to public distribution system
                  access, controlling for other covariates, in its
                  contribution to calorie intake. Results also suggest
                  that the calorie-elasticity of PDS transfers is
                  twice as large compared to additional out-of-pocket
                  income equal to the cash equivalent of PDS
                  transfers. These are also confirmed by
                  non-parametric analysis of calorie intake of various
                  consumer groups. Although preliminary, these results
                  suggest caution in advocating cash transfers as
                  substitute of in-kind transfers. Finally, the paper
                  evaluates concerns about the financial implications
                  of the minimum support price-PDS system in light of
                  the recently enacted National Food Security Act. },

                  2050 may seem like a big enough challenge in itself,
                  but we also need to achieve this feat whilst, at the
                  same time, reducing adverse impacts of food
                  production on a whole range of ecosystem
                  services. One suggested response is ``sustainable
                  intensification'' which entails delivering safer,
                  nutritious food from the same area whilst
                  maintaining ecosystem service provision. In this
                  review, I examine sustainable intensification and
                  consider alternatives such as management of food
                  demand and waste reduction. I conclude that
                  sustainable intensification has a role to play, but
                  this must be accompanied by fundamental change in
                  global food systems. },

                  approach in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, the
                  present study examines the determinants of
                  enrolment, hospitalisation and financial protection
                  for below the poverty line households using data
                  from a large-scale survey conducted in Maharashtra
                  in 2012-13. Almost 50% of BPL households were found
                  to be non-poor and only 30% of them were aware about
                  RSBY. More importantly, the effect of RSBY on
                  catastrophic health expenditure was not found to be
                  statistically significant. Since commercial
                  insurance companies and their third party
                  administrators have limited interest in awareness
                  generation and enrolment, their role may be reviewed
                  and instead an independent public agency should be
                  given responsibility for enrolment of unorganised
                  sector workers. This would be a key step towards
                  achieving universal population coverage. However, in
                  the long run, the government should strengthen the
                  resource-starved public health system.},

                  community governance of forests, which has invoked
                  stiff opposition from forest dwellers in the region.

                  resistance, and other public health
                  issues. Multifunctionality is a framework that
                  integrates these diverse issues and has been
                  influential in international policy. This commentary
                  focuses on arguably the most prominent public health
                  issue at the moment: obesity. Though obesity could
                  be considered another multifunctional dimension, its
                  link to other conference topics is tenuous. Using
                  obesity as an argument to promote local produce or
                  achieve other multifunctional outcomes is very
                  questionable. Framing obesity as an issue of poverty
                  or food insecurity trivializes the continuing major
                  problem of hunger worldwide. }

	abstract = { Twenty-first-century food policy will have to
                  address a new set of fundamentals. Some are
                  relatively new such as climate change and peak oil,
                  and some merely new versions of very old ones such
                  as water, population, land pressures, labor, and
                  urbanisation. Policy-makers now need radically to
                  alter the policy mix inherited from the last major
                  policy reconfiguration in the mid-20th century. Then
                  the demon was supply, and poor health was mainly due
                  to underconsumption and poverty. The policy solution
                  was to raise output and reduce prices. Today the
                  challenge is more complex, a coexistence of over-,
                  under-, and malconsumption alongside continuing
                  gross inequalities within and between nations. The
                  article proposes that a new paradigm is emerging,
                  termed here ecological public health, which sees
                  human and planetary health as linked and food as a
                  key connection point. The article outlines aspects
                  of what this entails, stressing the need for food
                  policy to address not just supply but governance and
                  consumer cultural challenges too. Seven priorities
                  are proposed for policy-makers. }

	Abstract = {This report revisits the theoretical concepts of
                  inequalities including their measurements, analyzes
                  their global trends, presents the policy makers'
                  perception of inequalities in 15 countries and
                  identifies various policy options in combating this
                  major development challenge of our time. The report
                  makes the basic point that in spite of the
                  impressive progress humanity has made on many fronts
                  over the decades, it still remains deeply
                  divided. In that context, it is intended to help
                  development actors, citizens, and policy makers
                  contribute to global dialogues and initiate
                  conversations in their own countries about the
                  drivers and extent of inequalities, their impact,
                  and the ways in which they can be curbed. This
                  report was prepared by the Poverty Practice in the

	Abstract = {In recent years there has emerged a tendency towards
                  profit-oriented production and investment in land by
                  a section of the cultivating population. Many
                  observers think they see a new class of capitalist
                  farmers emerging. There had been, however, no
                  quantitative studies attempting to isolate the
                  characteristics of capitalist farmers or to apply
                  any criteria to identify the capitalists. Ashok
                  Rudra with A Majid and B D Talib carried out a
                  sample survey of big farmers in Punjab and, after
                  attempting to isolate the capitalists from the
                  sample by certain statistical methods, came to the
                  conclusion that no group of capitalist farmers could
                  be identified. The author conducted a small survey
                  in 1969 of 66 big farmers scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states. The aim was to concentrate on
                  detailed case studies of big farmers selected
                  purposively with a wide geographical scatter. The
                  results of the survey show that a new class of
                  capitalist farmers is emerging. This is a phenomenon
                  common to every region, insofar as every area has
                  been subject to the same forces - albeit operating
                  with varying intensity - of an expanding market and
                  enhanced profitability of agricultural
                  production. The rate at which capitalist development
                  is occurring varies widely in different regions
                  depending on many historical and current
                  circumstances; it may be near zero in some: but the
                  reality of the process cannot be denied.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that a very considerable
                  difference is made to the behaviour of farm
                  variables with changing economic size of farms (i e,
                  changing scale of production), depending on how we
                  measure this economic size. With acreage as the
                  measure of economic size, i e, of the scale of
                  production, we obtain one set of results; with an
                  alternative index of the scale of production, we may
                  obtain diametrically opposite results. Further, in a
                  situation of changing techniques, as at present, the
                  grouping of farm data by acreage is likely to
                  obscure some very important features of the dynamics
                  of agricultural change. We propose to illustrate the
                  argument with data on farm economics collected by us
                  as part of a study of the growth of capitalist
                  farming from 66 large farms scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states in 1969. [The author would

                  of data on irrigation. Collection of data on
                  different types of irrigation systems in the state
                  has been left to different agencies. These agencies
                  are not geared to systematic collection of
                  statistics and the data provided by them are not
                  regular and are often inconsistent. As a result, no
                  reliable statistics exist that could be used to
                  identify patterns of irrigation at the state-level -
                  leave aside doing such exercises at district, block
                  or village levels - with a level of accuracy that is
                  possible for some of the other states. This paper

	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine inequality in incomes
                  between households of different castes in rural
                  {I}ndia, using a unique dataset comprising household
                  data from a cross-section of eight villages across
                  four States. The focus of this paper is on Dalit or
                  Scheduled Caste households. We begin with very
                  simple measures of differences between groups, such
                  as proportional representation in different
                  quintiles and the frequency distribution of
                  households across income levels in different social
                  groups. We then estimate a standard GE(2) inequality
                  index along with its decomposition by caste. Lastly,
                  we compute an alternative benchmark for assessing
                  the share of between-group inequality in total
                  inequality as suggested by Elbers, Lanjouw,
                  Mistiaen, and Ozler (ELMO 2008). Our analysis shows
                  high levels of income inequality between households
                  of different caste groups.},

	Number = 16,
	Volume = 44,
	Abstract = {The 61st round (2004-05) of the National Sample
                  Survey showed that there was a turnaround in
                  employment growth in rural India after a phase of
                  jobless growth during the 1990s. Paradoxically, this
                  employment growth occurred during a period of
                  widespread distress in the agricultural sector with
                  low productivity, price instability and stagnation
                  leading to indebtedness. This paper reveals that
                  employment growth in the rural areas was probably a
                  response to the income crisis that is gripping
                  farming. Under conditions of distress, when income
                  levels fall below sustenance, then the normally
                  non-working population is forced to enter the labour
                  market to supplement household income. The decline
                  of the agricultural sector has also probably created
                  forced sectoral and regional mobility of the working
                  population, with the non-working population
                  complementing them.},

	Abstract = {&quot;Missing labour force in India&quot; - the
                  recent fluctuations in the labour participation of
                  women - is probably due to short-term shifts in
                  activities responding to favourable economic
                  conditions. Such fluctuations need to be placed in
                  the context of a structural change in labour
                  participation wherein the share of women in the
                  labour force as well as labour participation rate of
                  women has been declining for the last quarter of a
                  century. Upward social mobility in Indian
                  patriarchal society in the wake of growing incomes
                  is probably symbolised by women&#39;s withdrawal
                  from paid labour and their confinement to unpaid
                  domestic activities. Even under such adverse
                  conditions employment growth of women is not
                  stagnant. Those who do enter and remain in the
                  labour market are women from the most vulnerable
                  households, as marginalised informal paid labour,
                  thus feminising the most precarious forms of labour
                  in the country. },

	abstract = { With its focus on the quantity of production, often
                  to the exclusion of other goals, today's food system
                  is on an unsustainable course. The problem begins
                  with and is driven by industrialized production of
                  both crops and animals. Industrialization is a
                  product of technological change, public policy, and,
                  most recently, globalized trade. The lack of
                  sustainability derives from reliance on the
                  intensive use of nonrenewable and hard-to-renew
                  resources--soil, antibiotics, fresh water, and
                  fossil fuels, for example--but also from the waste
                  and pollution created by the industrial model. For
                  at least 50 years, American agriculture policies
                  have promoted production of, and ultimately lower
                  market prices for, commodity crops like corn, wheat,
                  and soybeans. Over the last 3 decades in particular,
                  these "cheap food" policies have exacerbated the
                  negative impacts of an industrialized agriculture on
                  the health of the agro-ecosystem, as well as on the
                  health of the humans who must share and be sustained
                  by it. Sustainability and health are two sides of
                  the same food system coin. Policies that put US food
                  production on more sustainable footing can help aid
                  in public efforts to address the myriad crises
                  confronting both the food and health systems. }

                  inequality is a determinant of population health is
                  still regarded as a controversial issue. We decided
                  to review the evidence and see if we could find a
                  consistent interpretation of both the positive and
                  negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155
                  papers reporting research findings on the
                  association between income distribution and
                  population health, and classified them according to
                  how far their findings supported the hypothesis that
                  greater income differences are associated with lower
                  standards of population health. Analyses in which
                  all adjusted associations between greater income
                  equality and higher standards of population health
                  were statistically significant and positive were
                  classified as “wholly supportive”; if none were
                  significant and positive they were classified as
                  “unsupportive”; and if some but not all were
                  significant and supportive they were classified as
                  “partially supportive”. Of those classified as
                  either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large
                  majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less
                  good in societies where income differences are
                  bigger. There were substantial differences in the
                  proportion of supportive findings according to
                  whether inequality was measured in large or small
                  areas. We suggest that the studies of income
                  inequality are more supportive in large areas
                  because in that context income inequality serves as
                  a measure of the scale of social stratification, or
                  how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three
                  explanations for the unsupportive findings reported
                  by a minority of studies. First, many studies
                  measured inequality in areas too small to reflect
                  the scale of social class differences in a society;
                  second, a number of studies controlled for factors
                  which, rather than being genuine confounders, are
                  likely either to mediate between class and health or
                  to be other reflections of the scale of social
                  stratification; and third, the international
                  relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the
                  youngest age groups) during the decade from the
                  mid-1980s when income differences were widening
                  particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We
                  finish by discussing possible objections to our
                  interpretation of the findings.}

                  conventional approach of decomposing income
                  inequality by population sub-groups. Specifically,
                  they propose a measure that evaluates observed
                  between-group inequality against a benchmark of
                  maximum between-group inequality that can be
                  attained when the number and relative sizes of
                  groups under examination are fixed. The authors
                  argue that such a modification can provide a
                  complementary perspective on the question of whether
                  a particular population breakdown is salient to an
                  assessment of inequality in a country. As their
                  measure normalizes between-group inequality by the
                  number and relative sizes of groups, it is also less
                  subject to problems of comparability across
                  different settings. The authors show that for a
                  large set of countries their assessment of the
                  importance of group differences typically increases
                  substantially on the basis of this approach. The
                  ranking of countries (or different population
                  groups) can also differ from that obtained using
                  traditional decomposition methods. Finally, they
                  observe an interesting pattern of higher levels of
                  overall inequality in countries where their measure
                  finds higher between-group contributions.},

  abstract =     { This article examines economic and social relations
                  in order to understand political assertion and
                  mobilisation among rural bonded labourers in the
                  Pakistan Punjab. Bonded labour, characterised by
                  economic and extra-economic forms of
                  compulsion together with vertical ties of patronage,
                  remains widespread in the region. I propose that the
                  perpetuation of these relations is largely explained
                  by the capture of state institutions by a
                  traditional landlord elite and its monopoly over the
                  means of coercion coupled with a highly seasonal
                  demand for labour. I examine how employment and
                  indebtedness combine to restrict workers'
                  physical and economic mobility. I argue that
                  labourers have not been able to unite politically as
                  a class and challenge their employers because years
                  of authoritarian rule in Pakistan have entrenched a
                  highly factional style of politics dominated by the
                  landed elites. My article contributes to the
                  literature on agrarian change, class formation and
                  the state in south Asia. }
